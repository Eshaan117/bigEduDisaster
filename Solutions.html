						 <p>India has a population more than a billion still has not produced much gold medals? You might say that may be we dont have money and will not give this talk a push this is because people in India or I should rather say in schools in India more 
						 emphasis is laid on grades , test scores but not on sports thats one main reason.
						 </p>
						 <p>If there is a nation which is the youngest of all then it is India. And surely there might have been many people who were willing to represent their nation in Olympics but were not given
						 any support too , ofcourse schools did not support then why would even parents?

						 <p>According to me more focus should be laid on skill devolopement and not just on one thing that everyone cherishes in India and that is
						 marks.  Basic skills like enterpreneurship , leadership , art of happiness and time management   should be taught in schools.

<p>Most of the innovations which have taken overtime have all been made by Americans , how? Well look
take a look around yourself Google , Twitter , Facebook , Tesla , Apple , Oracle , Instagram , Boston Dynamics , WhatsApp itself.
These are just a few but there are many more in many other different industries!

 <p>
 May be this is because they have comparatevely a nice education system cause again you need good sorts of education as well , fools can't make innovation.

					   <p>
					   If he was born here this question might not have been made. He might probably might have fallen a prey to this crappy education system
					   where his parents would have compared to others for what grades and percentages he was actually getting! Instead of allowing him to code he would have been 
					   pressurized to clear extreme competetive examination where his creative skills would have never been asked but would have surely got stuck on the problem of solving an
					   MCQ in less time . Look my intention is not talking about that Math  and Physics are not important  , infact they are important cause they have played a helpful
					   amount of role in changing the world we live now . All things we see right now may not have ever existed if Math and Science never existed , main thing is about curiosity!
