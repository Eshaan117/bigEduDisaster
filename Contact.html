						  kids are the most curious creature of all , they have the ability to grasp things that an average person thinks 
						  are impossible to be done . But on the other hand "THE EDUCATION SYSTEM" in India has not been capable of making learning
                          an interesting task and hence the students find it extremely boring.<br/><br/><br/> They dont study to master the subject and for the sake of learning it but instead study
						  just to get a 90% as a test score which typically may be the reason why there are no nobel laureates in India and neither there are any sci-innovation happening in India.
